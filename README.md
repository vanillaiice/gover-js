> This project is forked from [gover](https://github.com/vanillaiice/gover), which is a package version management tool for Go projects.

gover-js is package version management tool for JavaScript projects.

Instead of manually incrementing the version number in your code (ðŸ—¿),
you can simply use `gover-js` to automatically do it.
Also, you can use `gover-js` to tag the git branch to the current version of your project (using `git tag`).

Under the hood, `gover-js` will read your `package.json` file in your project
and update the version number accordingly.

# Installation

```sh
$ go install github.com/vanillaiice/gover-js@latest
```

# Usage

First, initialize your js project with your favorite package manager:

```sh
# bun
$ bun init
# npm
$ npm init
```

Then, you can simply increment the version string in the `package.json` file using the `gover-js bump` command:

```
# bump to major version (e.g. v1.0.0 -> v2.0.0)
$ gover-js bump --major
# bump to minor version (e.g. v1.0.0 -> v1.1.0) with verbose log from custom package.json file
$ gover-js -V bump --minor -f pkg.json
```
